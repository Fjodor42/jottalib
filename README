JOTTALIB
===========

This is not an official Jottacloud client. It is developed according to the company founder's instructions at
http://forum.jotta.no/jotta/topics/api_http

So what is it, then?
===========

This is a bare-bones, pythonic interface to the Jottacloud backup/cloud storage service. The service itself exposes
a nice and simple HTTP REST api, and this library wraps that interface in a python module, in the hope that it may
be useful.

All code is GPLv3 licensed. 

There is also a FUSE implementation in here, mostly to test the library, but it is fully working and ready for use as 
a file system.

Caveats
=======

As per February 2014, there still is no official word on how to get write permission to the API. As such, the library
will only read from Jottacloud, and cannot write anything.

Requirements
============
The mandatory modules are listed in requirements.txt (`pip -r requirements.txt` will get you everything you need).

Optional requirements
---------------------
fusepy for Fuse client
python-qt4 for the Qt models

How to get started 
======================

Export your Jottacloud username and password to the running environment. Running macosx or linux, it would normally go 
like this:

export JOTTACLOUD_USERNAME=""
export JOTTACLOUD_PASSWORD=""

Fuse client
===========

1. Create a folder where you want your Jottacloud file system: 

       mkdir $HOME/jottafs

2. Run Fuse: 

       jottafuse.py $HOME/jottafs
